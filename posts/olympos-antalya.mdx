<Paragraph>
First, I could not imagine that people lived in such an amazing place. What they were doing? What was their fun?
Were they happy? How they arrived here as we hardly managed to? What did they imagine about this place first, and what did they find?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
First time in my life I realized how ignorant I was about history.
My ignorance about a subject had never hurt me so much.
I tried to satisfy my curiosity by reading something from here and there, but I couldn't. Dozens of points that I could not connect were formed in my mind.

<Paragraph>
I started reading. I realized that we might not be smarter than people 2000 years ago.
I thought that we might be living far away from the way we should live. I understood that the new might not always be better than the old.

<Paragraph>
It is debatable whether it is good or bad, but if there is a certainty, it is that we live differently.
The people living here did not have predetermined lives. They were not isolated from life at the cost of being safe.
Since the end of loneliness was death, they had much stronger social consciousness.
