  <Paragraph>
    Olympos dates back to the Hellenistic period and was one of the six leading cities of the Lycian League.
    The city flourished under Roman rule but later faced challenges due to pirate attacks.
    It was eventually abandoned, but its ruins remain a testament to its historical importance.
    <br />
    The Lycians are believed to have been an indigenous people, with their roots going back to the Bronze Age.
    They spoke the Lycian language, which is part of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family.
    Inscriptions in Lycian have been found, providing valuable insights into their language and culture.

<Paragraph>
First time in my life I realized how ignorant I was about history.
My ignorance about a subject had never hurt me so much.
I tried to satisfy my curiosity by reading something from here and there, but I couldn't. Dozens of points that I could not connect were formed in my mind.

<Paragraph>
I thought about what people felt during the earthquake in 141 AD while walking among the structures that had experienced a great earthquake.
Did they see the earthquake as the anger of the gods or as a natural event? Before the gods were invented, how were natural events explained?

  <Paragraph>
    In 141 AD, the Lycian people, like many other ancient civilizations, likely interpreted natural disasters such as earthquakes through a religious and mythological lens.
    By that time, the Lycian region, which is in modern-day southwestern Turkey, had been influenced by various cultures, including Greek and Roman, both of which had well-established pantheons of gods and mythological explanations for natural phenomena.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The Lycians themselves had their own pantheon of gods before the heavy influence of Greek and Roman deities. They might have believed that earthquakes were a sign of displeasure or punishment from their gods.
    For instance, in Greek mythology, Poseidon, the god of the sea, was also known as the "Earth-shaker" who could cause earthquakes when he struck the ground with his trident. Similarly, the Romans had Vulcan, the god of fire and volcanoes, who was also associated with earthquakes.

<Paragraph>
I started reading. I realized that we might not be smarter than people 2000 years ago.
I thought that we might be living far away from the way we should live. I understood that the new might not always be better than the old.

<Paragraph>
It is debatable whether it is good or bad, but if there is a certainty, it is that we live differently.
The people living here did not have predetermined lives. They were not isolated from life at the cost of being safe.
Since the end of loneliness was death, they had much stronger social consciousness.
