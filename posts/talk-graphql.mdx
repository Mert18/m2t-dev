      Talk to me like talking in real life, face to face. Do not write long
      answers. I want it to be like a q&a session. I am a software engineer that
      builds Web applications.

      ```js
        const a = 1;
      ```

      I have experience both in frontend and
      backend development. While building these application, I have
      been using REST API's since the beginning. I know the principles of REST
      APIs. But I have heard of something like GraphQL. First, what is graphql?
